| --- | ------- | --- | ----- | ---- | ---------- | --- | -------- | ----- |
•
| Cloud |     | Grading | Reduces | the | Load | on Your | Laptop: |     |
| ----- | --- | ------- | ------- | --- | ---- | ------- | ------- | --- |
At the submission deadlines (03:00 PM on Day 1 and 02:00 PM on Day 2), the official GitHub
Actions Autograder runs your docker-compose.yml file on GitHub’s cloud runner, which has 16
| GB  | of RAM | and | uses | ubuntu-latest. |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | --- | ---- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Your laptop does not need to run every container simultaneously during the official grading process.
•
| Split | Local | Testing |     | Across | Team Members: |     |     |     |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | --- | ------ | ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
During the coding sprint, teams using laptops with 8 GB or 16 GB of RAM should distribute local
testing workloads across teammates’ machines connected through the team’s phone hotspot.
| A   | suggested | arrangement |         | is:      |                 |     |     |     |
| --- | --------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- | --------------- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |           |             | Backend | services | and containers. |     |     |     |

by processes running inside the container, including browser processes.
– SE_START_VNC: "false" disables the VNC service that provides a remotely viewable browser
|     | desktop | in  | Selenium | browser | containers. |     |     |     |

These settings are intended to reduce unnecessary resource usage during local testing.
| 4.  | Zero-Overnight |     | Integrity |     | & Cloud | Autograding |     | Rules |
| --- | -------------- | --- | --------- | --- | ------- | ----------- | --- | ----- |
1.
|     | Personal | GitHub | Account |     | and Empty | Repository |     | at 10:40 AM: |
| --- | -------- | ------ | ------- | --- | --------- | ---------- | --- | ------------ |
Create a private GitHub repository under the team lead’s personal GitHub account, which provides
2,000 free GitHub Actions minutes, and invite nascon-eval-26 to the repository.
At 10:40 AM on Day 1, the repository must be completely empty, with zero commits.
All project scaffolding, Dockerfiles, and source code must be committed after 10:45 AM.
| 2.  | Hourly | Commit | Rule: |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Teams must push their code to GitHub at least once every hour during the coding sprints.
|     | Each missed | hourly | push | incurs | a penalty | of  | 2 points. |     |
| --- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | ------ | --------- | --- | --------- | --- |
3.
|     | GitHub | Server | Timestamps |     | Determine |     | Eligibility: |     |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ---------- | --- | --------- | --- | ------------ | --- |
Only commits pushed to GitHub by 03:05:00 PM PKT on Day 1 and 02:05:00 PM PKT on Day 2
|     | are eligible | for | grading. |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | ------------ | --- | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
3

Local files that have not been committed, Git stashes, and pushes made after the respective dead-
lines are ignored by the cloud autograder.
4. Zero Overnight Commits:
Between 03:05 PM PKT on Day 1 and 10:15 AM PKT on Day 2, no commits may be pushed to
GitHub.
On Day 2, the repository history must continue directly from the locked Day 1 commit SHA (the
unique identifier of the commit).
5. AI Tools and Top-8 Live Mutation Viva:
AI tools, including Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, and Copilot, are fully allowed.
Managed backend-as-a-service platforms (BaaS), including Firebase and Supabase, are prohibited.
Using pre-built repositories is also prohibited.
After the Day 2 cloud audit, the eight highest-scoring teams advance to a 10-minute viva with the
judge.
The viva includes:
• A 5-minute live code mutation task.
• Two hidden complexity scenarios.
• A defense of eight short Architecture Decision Records documented in ADR.md.
• A defense of the traceability matrix documented in TRACEABILITY.md.
5. Tie-Breakers & Penalty Floor
All individual item scores and total scores are floored at zero. No score can fall below zero.
Any tie, including a tie for qualification among the Top 8 teams or for the first- and second-place
prizes, is resolved using the following criteria in order:
1. Higher objective score on Day 2.
2. More automated test vectors passed across both days.
3. Earlier final GitHub push timestamp on Day 2.
